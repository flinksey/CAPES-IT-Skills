# UP CAPES IT Committee Skills Test

#### Note to Evaluator
Due to time constraints on my end, I decided to submit the link to my work before figuring out how to implement my ideas (refer: Figma link) for alternative designs. The details for each file are found below. 

### SkillsTest.html
- This file contains the code used to implement the minimum requirements of the skills test.
- The minimum requirements of the test were as follows:
  - Clicking on either radio button for the Light and Dark themes should enable switching between them.
  - Once the user clicks "Submit": (1) icons should appear to indicate whether there was input or not and (2) there should be a message to indicate either success or an error.

### Files in "Separated" Folder
These files provide pretty much the same functionality as the SkillsTest.html, the main difference being that the CSS and Javascript blocks are in separate files and are called within the .html file. 
- SkillsTest - Experimentation.html
- skills_test_exp.css
- skills_test_exp.js  

[This](https://www.figma.com/file/0aUksSOiGVgprNd2GZqrq0/Skills-Test-Experimentation?node-id=0%3A1) is the link to the draft I'm working on in Figma, where I'm brainstorming the layout and design.

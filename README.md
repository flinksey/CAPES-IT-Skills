# UP CAPES IT Committee Skills Test
### Minimum Requirements for Given Design
- **Light and Dark Themes** - the user should be able to toggle between the two
- **Form Validation (Submit onclick)** - the user should submit inputs at least 1 character in length

### Desired Features of Alternative Design
- **Light and Dark Themes**
  - The toggle button is a slider.
- **Form Validation**
  - Checks whether the inputs are not just spaces.
  - Limits the number of digits for the Contact Number. Spaces between numbers are not counted.
  - Checks whether the input for the Contact Number is actually a mobile number (Philippines).
  - Checks formatting of the number (09XX XXX XXXX instead of +63 XXX XXX XXXX).
  - Checks whether information has already been saved.
- **Display**
  - Instead of the screen being divided into to 2 columns, the confirmation/error message will be displayed in the same space as the form.
